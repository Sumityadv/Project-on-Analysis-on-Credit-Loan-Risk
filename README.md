Credit Risk Analysis through Exploratory Data Insights

This project explores credit risk patterns in loan applicants using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). By analyzing demographic, financial, and behavioral data of borrowers, the study uncovers key factors that influence loan approval, repayment, and default tendencies. The analysis provides actionable insights that can be used by financial institutions to improve credit scoring models and enhance risk management strategies.

Objectives

To clean and preprocess borrower credit datasets for accurate analysis.

To investigate demographic and financial attributes that affect loan outcomes.

To identify risk patterns using visualization and statistical analysis.

To provide business-driven insights for loan approval and risk assessment.

Dataset

10,000+ borrower credit records with attributes such as income, loan amount, marital status, credit history, and repayment status.

Included both categorical and numerical variables, requiring preprocessing.

Workflow

Data Preprocessing

Handled missing values, outliers, and skewed distributions.

Applied appropriate encoding for categorical variables (marital status, education, credit history).

Standardized financial attributes like income and loan amount for consistency.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Conducted univariate analysis to study distributions of income, loan amount, and repayment history.

Performed bivariate analysis to uncover relationships between loan approval and key features such as credit history and applicant income.

Built 15+ statistical visualizations (heatmaps, histograms, bar charts, and boxplots) to interpret borrower behavior.

Insights & Results

Found credit history and applicant income to be the strongest predictors of loan approval.

Identified risk-prone borrower segments such as high-loan/low-income applicants.

Created borrower risk profiles (low, medium, high) to support better decision-making in lending.

Documentation & Presentation

Structured the entire project in a Jupyter Notebook with code, explanations, and business-oriented insights.

Provided a data storytelling approach to bridge technical findings with practical financial applications
